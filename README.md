# Simple-Banking-System

A simple Python-based banking system simulator which I created as part of JetBrains Academy's Python track; it can create new accounts, assign valid credit card numbers which pass the Luhn Algorithm, store account data in a database, allow users to log in and carry out transactions, and allow users to delete their account information.
